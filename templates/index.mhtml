We realise how many people are keen on the markets and trading and trying to get in to the Investment Banking Industry. Since the practical side doesn't really get covered a whole lot at Uni we have subsequently started a trading club!
</p>
<p>
Auckland University Trading Club is a student run society. We will have plenty of competitions this year that will expose you to the pressure and excitement of floor trading (simulations Investment Banks actually use) and stock movements with a bundle of cash for the winners.
</p>
<p>
Come along and get involved, you will learn a lot about the investment banking industry and how to trade stocks. Anyone is welcome to join, no matter your level of experience!
Check out our competitions page and register now. Membership is only $5 p.a.
