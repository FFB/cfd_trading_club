<p>
The heart-pumping atmosphere of an open outcry stock exchange will be recreated in this series of trading competitions. Students will compete in teams of 2 to determine who can trade their way to victory. The prize for first place will be up to $500.
</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

Registration is not yet open.
</p>

<h2>Format</h2>
<p>The Open Outcry competition will consist of 5 trading sessions over weeks 4-11 (official dates TBA).</p>
<p>Each team will have 2 members - an analyst and a trader. During each trading session teams will trade a stock whose price will randomly change throughout the session. Each session will consist of five trading rounds which will be three minutes long.</p>
<p>Teams must trade against each other as the stock price changes over time to get the best price. This is fast-paced, loud, in your face and a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>At the end of the game net positions are calculated and the team who has made the most money wins! (Basic strategy tip: buy low, sell high!) </p>
