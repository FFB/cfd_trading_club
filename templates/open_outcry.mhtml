The heart-pumping atmosphere of an open outcry stock exchange will be recreated in this series of trading competitions. Students will compete in teams of 2 to determine who can trade their way to victory. The prize for first place will be up to $500.

<h2>Format</h2>
<p>
The Open Outcry competition will consist of 5 trading sessions over weeks 4-11 (official dates TBA). During each trading session teams will trade an imaginary stock whose price changes based on a dice throw, a deck of cards or something similar. As the stock price changes over time teams must shout out the value they are prepared to buy or sell the stock at and make trades with other teams doing the same. At the end of the game net positions are calculated and the team who has made the most money wins! (Basic strategy tip: buy low, sell high!)
