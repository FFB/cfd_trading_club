<p>If you have a keen interest in global markets or just enjoy gambling then the Market Movement competition is for you!</p>
<p>This competition will span a period of 4 weeks (likely to be held week 8 through week 11). During these 4 weeks competitors will be given the chance to make simple predictions about market conditions.</p>
<p>"Will the price of gold move up or down in the next 12 hours?"</p>
<p>"Will the AUDNZD exchange rate move up or down in the next 12 hours?"</p>

<p>Competitors will need to make predictions similar to the examples above on world stock indicies, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Sound complicated? Its not! Even if you have little knowledge of whats going on in the world, predictions are always either up or down. This means that a monkey should get half of them right! There are however at least 30 predictions to be made so only a very lucky monkey will take out the top prize of up to <b>$500</b>.</p>
